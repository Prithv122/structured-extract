`pandas.DataFrame` columns of an `object` dtype require some special care, since this stores values of arbitrary type.
To convert these columns to DuckDB, we first go through an analyze phase before converting the values.
In this analyze phase a sample of all the rows of the column are analyzed to determine the target type.
This sample size is by default set to 1000.
If the type picked during the analyze step is incorrect, this will result in `Invalid Input Error: Failed to cast value`, in which case you will need to increase the sample size.
The sample size can be changed by setting the `pandas_analyze_sample` config option.

```python
